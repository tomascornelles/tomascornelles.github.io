In today's digital age, technology permeates every facet of our lives. From the smartphones we carry to the complex systems that power our cities, computers are at the heart of it all. But how do these machines understand what to do? The answer lies in the fascinating world of programming.

Programming is, at its core, the art of communicating with machines. It's about crafting a set of precise instructions that tell a computer exactly how to perform a specific task.  Think of it like giving directions to a robot.  Imagine you want the robot to turn on a light. For you, it's a simple flick of a switch. But for the robot, you need to break it down into a series of detailed steps:

- Walk to the switch
- Extend your arm
- Flip the switch
- Lower your arm
- Return to your position


## What is programming?

Programming is the process of creating a sequence of ordered steps that a machine must follow to perform a task. In the field of computer science, it refers to the creation of programs or applications by writing source code, which contains the instructions that the computer executes.


## Programming Language

A programming language is a set of rules and symbols that allow programmers to communicate with computers. It is like an artificial language with a specific structure that defines how instructions should be written.

The source code, written in a programming language, is translated into machine language that the computer can understand and execute.

## What is programming for?

Programming allows you to create programs and applications that perform various tasks, from games and mobile applications to operating systems and business software. Its main objective is to automate tasks, solve problems, and facilitate interaction between humans and computers.


## Very brief history of programming

Programming has evolved from the first machine languages, difficult to understand and write, to high-level languages, closer to human language.

* **Machine language:** The first language used, based on the binary system (0 and 1), which is the only one that the computer understands directly.
* **Assembly language:** A more readable language than machine language, which uses abbreviations to represent instructions.
* **High-level languages:** More abstract and easy-to-use languages, which allow programmers to write code more efficiently. Some examples are C, Java, Python and JavaScript.


## Types of programming

There are different programming approaches, each with its own characteristics and advantages:

* **Structured programming:** It focuses on dividing the program into smaller, easier-to-understand blocks of code, using control structures such as loops and conditionals.
* **Modular programming:** Similar to structured programming, but divides the program into independent modules that can be reused in other projects.
* **Object-oriented programming (OOP):** It is based on the concept of "objects", which are entities that combine data and actions. OOP facilitates the organization and reuse of code.


## Elements of programming

Some key elements in programming are:

* **Reserved words:** Words with a special meaning within the language, which cannot be used for other purposes.
* **Operators:** Symbols that represent mathematical or logical operations, such as +, -, *, / and ==.
* **Variables:** Memory spaces that store data that can change during the execution of the program.
* **Constants:** Values that do not change during the execution of the program.
* **Identifiers:** Names given to variables, constants and other elements of the program to be able to refer to them.


## Learn to program

If you want to learn to program, there are many resources available, from online tutorials and courses to books and universities. The key is to start with a simple language and practice regularly to develop your skills.

**Scratch** is an excellent tool for beginners, as it allows you to learn the basic concepts of programming in a visual and interactive way.


## Conclusion

Programming is a fundamental skill in today's world, as it allows us to interact with technology and create innovative solutions. If you are interested in technology and problem solving, programming can be a rewarding and opportunity-filled career.
