Agile Methodology and the Scrum framework have become essential elements in the world of software development. These methodologies have revolutionized how development teams work, enabling greater flexibility, collaboration, and adaptability to changes in projects. In this article, I want to focus on the developers' perspective and how Agile and Scrum have transformed the way they approach their work. For many, this is already the usual way of working for the most of us, but not in other places.

## What is Scrum?

Scrum is an agile framework based on iteration and continuous collaboration. It was developed to address common challenges in software development, such as constant changes in requirements and the need to deliver value regularly. Scrum principles include transparency, inspection, and adaptation, allowing teams to be more agile and effective in their work.

## The Importance of Developers in Scrum

Developers play a crucial role in Scrum. They are responsible for creating the product, and their constant and collaborative work is essential for project success. In Scrum, developers work in multifunctional teams that include members with different skills, such as analysts, testers, and designers. This encourages collaboration and a diversity of perspectives, often leading to more innovative solutions.

## Roles in Scrum

In Scrum, developers are not the only ones with defined roles. There are also other key roles, such as the Scrum Master and the Product Owner.

### Scrum Master

The Scrum Master acts as a facilitator and team leader, ensuring that Scrum principles are followed and obstacles for the development team are removed.

### Product Owner

The Product Owner is responsible for defining product requirements and priorities, working closely with developers to ensure the delivery of a high-value product.

## Agile Practices in Development

Scrum promotes a series of agile practices that are fundamental to developers' success. Some of these practices include:

### Sprints

Sprints are fixed and short periods (usually 2 to 4 weeks) during which specific product functionality or a set of tasks is developed. This allows for regular delivery and the ability to adapt to changes in requirements.

### Planning

At the beginning of each Sprint, tasks to be performed during it are planned, with the entire team agreeing on the workload. It may be useful for the Scrum Master and Product Owner to meet beforehand to discuss the tasks to be presented in the planning with the rest of the team.

### Daily Standup Meetings

Daily standup meetings are a key part of Scrum. During these meetings, team members share progress, obstacles, and goals for the day. This fosters communication and collaboration among developers. The meeting should be as brief as possible, and each team member should address these three questions:

- What did I do yesterday?
- What will I do today?
- Do I need help with anything?

### Review and Retrospective

At the end of each sprint, a review is conducted to showcase completed work and receive feedback. The retrospective is an opportunity for the team to reflect on its process and make continuous improvements.

## Benefits for Developers

Developers experience several benefits when working with Scrum and in an Agile environment:

- Greater clarity in requirements and objectives.
- Fewer interruptions and last-minute changes.
- Increased participation in decision-making.
- Greater visibility of project progress.
- Higher job satisfaction due to a more collaborative work environment.

## Challenges for Developers

Despite the benefits, there are also challenges for developers in an Agile and Scrum environment:

- The need to maintain a constant delivery pace can be demanding.
- Intensive collaboration and joint decision-making can lead to conflicts.
- Adaptation to constant changes can be stressful.

## Conclusions

In summary, Scrum and the Agile Methodology have transformed how developers approach their work. These methodologies encourage collaboration, adaptability, and regular delivery of value, benefiting both developers and clients. While challenges exist, the benefits far outweigh the difficulties, and Scrum has proven to be a perfect fit for developers in the pursuit of excellence in software development.
