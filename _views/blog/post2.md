To delete a branch in Git, you can use the git branch command with the -d or -D flag. Here's how you can do it:

    Delete a Merged Branch:

    If the branch you want to delete has been merged into another branch and you're sure you no longer need it, you can use the -d flag:

    bash

git branch -d branch_name

Replace branch_name with the name of the branch you want to delete.

Force Delete an Unmerged Branch:

If the branch you want to delete has not been merged yet, Git will prevent you from deleting it with the -d flag to avoid accidental data loss. In this case, you can use the -D flag to force delete the branch:

bash

    git branch -D branch_name

    Again, replace branch_name with the name of the branch you want to delete.

Remember that when you delete a branch, it's usually permanent. So make sure you're certain about deleting the branch before you proceed. If you accidentally delete a branch, it might be more challenging to recover it, especially if it hasn't been merged or backed up elsewhere.
